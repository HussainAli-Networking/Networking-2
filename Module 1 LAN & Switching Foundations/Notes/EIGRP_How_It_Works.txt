EIGRP Explained — How It Works, Step by Step
=============================================

This document is written so that if you read it from top to bottom, they will understand
WHAT EIGRP is, HOW it works internally, and WHY it behaves the way it does in a real network.


-------------------------------------------------
1. What EIGRP Really Is
-------------------------------------------------
EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol) is a routing protocol used to move traffic
inside a single organization or network domain.

At its core, EIGRP answers one question:
“What is the best path to reach a network, and how do I switch paths safely when something breaks?”

EIGRP is often called a hybrid protocol because:
- It behaves like a distance-vector protocol when advertising routes.
- It behaves like a link-state protocol when calculating paths and preventing loops.

-------------------------------------------------
2. The Big Picture: How EIGRP Operates
-------------------------------------------------
EIGRP works in four continuous phases:

1. Discover neighbors
2. Exchange routing information
3. Choose the best and backup paths
4. React instantly to failures

If you understand these four phases, you understand EIGRP.

-------------------------------------------------
3. Neighbor Discovery (How Routers Find Each Other)
-------------------------------------------------
EIGRP routers do NOT share routes with strangers.

They first discover neighbors using Hello packets.

- Hello packets are sent out EIGRP-enabled interfaces.
- If another router receives the Hello and all parameters match,
  the routers become neighbors.

For two routers to become EIGRP neighbors, they MUST match:
- Autonomous System Number (ASN)
- K-values (metric calculation settings)
- Network/subnet
- Authentication (if configured)

Once neighbors form, EIGRP builds trust.
Only trusted neighbors exchange routes.

-------------------------------------------------
4. Reliable Communication (Why EIGRP Is Efficient)
-------------------------------------------------
EIGRP does NOT flood the entire network like OSPF.
It also does NOT send full routing tables like RIP.

Instead, EIGRP uses:
- Partial updates (only changed routes)
- Bounded updates (only to neighbors that need them)

EIGRP uses RTP (Reliable Transport Protocol) to:
- Guarantee delivery when required
- Avoid unnecessary acknowledgments

This is why EIGRP converges fast without wasting bandwidth.

-------------------------------------------------
5. Understanding the EIGRP Metric (How Paths Are Chosen)
-------------------------------------------------
EIGRP does not care about hop count.
It cares about how “good” a path actually is.

By default, EIGRP calculates the metric using:
- Bandwidth (slowest link in the path)
- Delay (total delay across the path)

Important:
If bandwidth is configured wrong on interfaces,
EIGRP will choose bad paths even if the physical links are fast.

Simplified idea:
Lower metric = better path

-------------------------------------------------
6. DUAL — The Brain of EIGRP
-------------------------------------------------
DUAL (Diffusing Update Algorithm) is what makes EIGRP powerful.

DUAL ensures:
- No routing loops
- Fast convergence
- Backup paths are ready before failure

DUAL keeps track of all possible paths to a destination
and classifies them intelligently.

-------------------------------------------------
7. Successor and Feasible Successor (Critical Concepts)
-------------------------------------------------
Successor:
The best path to a network.
This is the route installed in the routing table.

Feasible Successor:
A backup path that is guaranteed to be loop-free.

Feasibility Condition:
A neighbor can be a feasible successor if:
The distance it reports to the destination
is LESS than the total distance of the current best path.

This rule is what prevents loops.

-------------------------------------------------
8. What Happens When a Link Fails
-------------------------------------------------
Scenario 1: Feasible successor exists
- EIGRP switches paths instantly.
- No queries.
- No delay.

Scenario 2: No feasible successor exists
- Route goes into ACTIVE state.
- Router sends queries to neighbors.
- Neighbors reply with alternatives.
- New successor is chosen.

If replies do not arrive in time,
the router declares a Stuck-In-Active (SIA) condition.

-------------------------------------------------
9. EIGRP Tables (How Information Is Organized)
-------------------------------------------------
Neighbor Table:
Who am I directly connected to?

Topology Table:
All known routes, including backups.
This is where DUAL works.

Routing Table:
Only the best paths actually used to forward traffic.

-------------------------------------------------
10. Load Balancing (One of EIGRP’s Superpowers)
-------------------------------------------------
EIGRP supports:
- Equal-cost load balancing (default)
- Unequal-cost load balancing using variance

Variance allows traffic to use multiple paths
even if they are not identical,
as long as they are loop-free.

-------------------------------------------------
11. EIGRP for IPv6 (Conceptually the Same)
-------------------------------------------------
EIGRP for IPv6 uses the same logic:
- Same DUAL algorithm
- Same metric calculation
- Same loop-prevention rules

The main difference is configuration style:
- Enabled per interface
- Uses a router ID

-------------------------------------------------
12. Why EIGRP Converges So Fast
-------------------------------------------------
EIGRP is fast because:
- Backup paths are pre-calculated
- Updates are small and targeted
- No full-table recomputation unless necessary

This is why EIGRP performs extremely well
in medium to large enterprise networks.

-------------------------------------------------
13. Final Mental Model (How to Think About EIGRP)
-------------------------------------------------
Think of EIGRP as:
A protocol that prepares for failure BEFORE failure happens.

It plans.
It verifies.
It switches instantly when needed.

If you understand neighbor discovery, metrics,
DUAL, and feasible successors,
you understand EIGRP.
