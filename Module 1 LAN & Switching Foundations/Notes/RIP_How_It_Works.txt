RIP Explained — How It Works, Step by Step
=============================================

This document is written so that if a you read it from start to finish,
they will clearly understand WHAT RIP is, HOW it works internally,
and WHY it behaves the way it does in real networks.

-------------------------------------------------
1. What RIP Really Is
-------------------------------------------------
RIP (Routing Information Protocol) is a distance-vector routing protocol.

At its core, RIP answers one basic question:
“How many routers do I have to pass through to reach a network?”

RIP does NOT try to be smart.
It does NOT build a full network map.
It relies entirely on information received from neighbors.

-------------------------------------------------
2. The Big Picture: How RIP Operates
-------------------------------------------------
RIP follows a simple loop:

1. Learn routes from neighbors
2. Count hops to each destination
3. Choose the path with the fewest hops
4. Periodically tell neighbors everything it knows

This simplicity makes RIP easy to understand,
but also limits how large a network can be.

-------------------------------------------------
3. Distance-Vector Logic (The Core Idea)
-------------------------------------------------
RIP routers trust their neighbors.

Each router tells its neighbors:
“I can reach this network in X hops.”

Neighbors add one hop and repeat the process.

There is no global view.
There is no verification.
This is why RIP is vulnerable to routing loops.

-------------------------------------------------
4. Hop Count Metric
-------------------------------------------------
RIP uses ONLY one metric:
Hop count.

Rules:
- Each router = 1 hop
- Maximum hop count = 15
- 16 hops = unreachable

This hard limit is why RIP cannot scale.

RIP does not care about:
- Bandwidth
- Delay
- Link quality

A slow link and a fast link look the same to RIP.

-------------------------------------------------
5. Routing Updates (Why RIP Is Noisy)
-------------------------------------------------
RIP sends full routing table updates every 30 seconds.

These updates:
- Are sent even if nothing has changed
- Consume bandwidth
- Slow down convergence

This behavior made sense decades ago.
It does not scale in modern networks.

-------------------------------------------------
6. Loop Prevention Mechanisms
-------------------------------------------------
Because RIP is simple, it needs extra rules to avoid loops.

Key mechanisms:

Split Horizon:
A router does not advertise a route back out the interface it learned it from.

Route Poisoning:
A failed route is advertised with a hop count of 16.

Hold-Down Timers:
Routers ignore bad news for a period to avoid instability.

These reduce loops but do not eliminate them.

-------------------------------------------------
7. What Happens When a Link Fails
-------------------------------------------------
When a link goes down:
- The route is marked unreachable (16 hops)
- The information spreads slowly
- Routers may temporarily believe bad information

This is known as slow convergence
and can cause routing loops during failures.

-------------------------------------------------
8. RIP Tables (How Information Is Stored)
-------------------------------------------------
RIP does NOT have multiple tables like OSPF or EIGRP.

It maintains:
- A routing table learned entirely from neighbors

There is no topology table.
There is no global database.

-------------------------------------------------
9. RIP Versions
-------------------------------------------------
RIPv1:
- Classful
- No subnet mask information
- Obsolete

RIPv2:
- Classless
- Supports CIDR and VLSM
- Supports authentication
- Uses multicast 224.0.0.9

RIPv2 is the only version worth studying today.

-------------------------------------------------
10. RIP for IPv6
-------------------------------------------------
RIPng is used for IPv6.

Conceptually:
- Same hop-count logic
- Same limitations
- Different packet format

-------------------------------------------------
11. Where RIP Still Makes Sense
-------------------------------------------------
RIP is useful when:
- The network is very small
- Simplicity matters more than efficiency
- Teaching routing fundamentals

RIP is NOT suitable for:
- Large networks
- Fast convergence requirements
- Modern enterprise environments

-------------------------------------------------
12. Final Mental Model (How to Think About RIP)
-------------------------------------------------
Think of RIP as:
A protocol that blindly trusts its neighbors
and counts routers along the way.

If the network is tiny, it works.
If the network grows, it breaks.

Understanding RIP helps you appreciate
why protocols like OSPF and EIGRP exist.
