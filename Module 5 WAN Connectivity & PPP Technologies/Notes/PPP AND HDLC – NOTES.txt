PPP AND HDLC 
========================

1) PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol)
--------------------------------
PPP is a Layer 2 protocol used on point-to-point links. It connects
exactly two devices and is commonly used between a customer router
and an ISP.

PPP does more than simple framing.

PPP provides:
- Encapsulation for Layer 3 protocols (IPv4, IPv6, etc.)
- LCP (Link Control Protocol) to establish, maintain, and terminate the link
- Authentication (CHAP, PAP)
- NCP (Network Control Protocols) to negotiate Layer 3 parameters

PPP characteristics:
- Open standard
- Vendor independent
- Supports authentication
- Supports negotiation
- Works only on point-to-point links

PPP can run over:
- Serial links
- Ethernet (PPPoE)
- Logical tunnels (legacy use)

PPP is NOT a LAN protocol.

------------------------------------------------------------

2) HDLC (High-Level Data Link Control)
-------------------------------------
HDLC is a Layer 2 protocol used on point-to-point links. It is simpler
than PPP and focuses only on encapsulation.

HDLC provides:
- Framing
- Error detection

HDLC does NOT provide:
- Authentication
- Link negotiation
- Dynamic Layer 3 configuration

On Cisco devices, HDLC usually means Cisco HDLC, which is proprietary.

HDLC characteristics:
- Simple and lightweight
- Fast with minimal overhead
- Cisco-to-Cisco only (Cisco HDLC)
- No authentication
- No negotiation

------------------------------------------------------------

3) PAP (Password Authentication Protocol)
-----------------------------------------
PAP is a PPP authentication method that uses a simple username and
password exchange.

How PAP works:
1. PPP link comes up
2. Client sends username and password in clear text
3. Server checks credentials
4. Access is granted or denied

PAP characteristics:
- Credentials are sent in plain text
- Authentication happens only once
- No protection against replay attacks
- Very weak security

PAP is used only when:
- Legacy devices are involved
- CHAP is not supported
- For labs and demonstrations

------------------------------------------------------------

4) CHAP (Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol)
-----------------------------------------------------
CHAP is a secure PPP authentication method based on challenge-response.

How CHAP works:
1. PPP link comes up
2. Server sends a random challenge
3. Client hashes the challenge with a shared secret
4. Client sends the hash result
5. Server performs the same calculation
6. If hashes match, authentication succeeds

CHAP characteristics:
- Password is never sent over the link
- Uses one-way hashing
- Protects against replay attacks
- Periodic re-authentication during the session
- Stronger than PAP

CHAP still requires:
- A shared secret stored locally
- Matching usernames (remote hostname on Cisco devices)

------------------------------------------------------------

5) PPP vs HDLC – Key Differences
--------------------------------

Encapsulation:
- PPP  : Encapsulation + control protocols
- HDLC : Encapsulation only

Authentication:
- PPP  : Yes (PAP, CHAP)
- HDLC : No

Negotiation:
- PPP  : Yes (LCP, NCP)
- HDLC : No

Standards:
- PPP  : Open standard
- HDLC : Cisco HDLC is proprietary

Interoperability:
- PPP  : Multi-vendor support
- HDLC : Cisco-to-Cisco only

Complexity:
- PPP  : More overhead, more features
- HDLC : Minimal overhead, minimal features

------------------------------------------------------------

6) When to Use PPP
------------------
- When authentication is required
- When connecting to an ISP
- When using multi-vendor devices
- When realistic WAN behavior is needed

------------------------------------------------------------

7) When to Use HDLC
-------------------
- When both devices are Cisco
- When simplicity is preferred
- When authentication is not required
- For quick or basic lab setups

------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
-------
HDLC is a simple point-to-point pipe.
PPP is a managed point-to-point protocol with authentication
and negotiation.

PAP is insecure and legacy.
CHAP is the minimum acceptable PPP authentication method.
