# Networking 2 — Study, Labs, and Teaching Material

This repository contains my **Networking 2 course material**, structured for **teaching, learning, and real understanding**.

It combines:
- Concept explanations
- Packet Tracer labs
- Configuration demos
- Troubleshooting scenarios
- Structured revision material

The methodology is practical and engineering-focused:

**Understand → Build → Verify → Break → Fix → Revise**

---

## Project Objective

This repository supports a **Networking 2 curriculum** delivered through:
- Concept-based YouTube videos
- Configuration and demo videos
- Packet Tracer labs
- Troubleshooting-driven learning
- Exam-oriented revision material

**Final outcome:**  
A learner can design, configure, verify, and troubleshoot a routed and switched network confidently.

## How Each Topic Is Handled

Every topic in this repository follows the same standard:

- Concept explanation
- Configuration and demonstration
- At least one Packet Tracer lab
- Verification and troubleshooting steps
- Clear learning outcomes

No topic is considered complete without a **working lab and verification**.

---

## Packet Tracer Lab Standards

Each Packet Tracer lab includes:
- Topology diagram
- IP addressing table
- Clear objectives
- Required commands
- Verification steps
- At least one intentional failure

Labs are designed to teach **why things break**, not just how to configure them.

---

## Tools & Environment
- **Packet Tracer** (primary student labs)
- **EVE-NG** (advanced labs and extensions)
- **Cisco IOS CLI**
- Verification-driven troubleshooting (`show`, `debug`, packet flow)

---

## Disclaimer
This repository contains **my personal teaching material, labs, and revision notes** based on hands-on practice.

It is **not official course material**.  
Always follow your institution’s syllabus and assessment requirements.
