# Networking 2 — Study, Labs, and Teaching Material

This repository contains my **Networking 2 course material**, structured for **teaching, learning, and real understanding**.

It combines:
- Concept explanations
- Packet Tracer labs
- Configuration demos
- Structured revision material

The methodology is practical and engineering-focused:

**Understand → Build → Verify → Break → Fix → Revise**

---

## Project Objective

This repository supports a **Networking 2 curriculum** delivered through:
- Concept-based YouTube videos
- Configuration and demo videos
- Packet Tracer labs
- Exam-oriented revision material

**Final outcome:**  
A learner can design, configure, verify, and troubleshoot a routed and switched network confidently.

---

## How Each Topic Is Handled

Every topic in this repository follows the same standard:

- Concept explanation
- Configuration and demonstration
- At least one Packet Tracer lab
- Verification and troubleshooting steps
- Clear learning outcomes

No topic is considered complete without a **working lab and verification**.

### MODULE 4 — Network Redundancy & High Availability  
*(HSRP, EtherChannel)*

**Focus:** Network resilience and redundancy

Topics include:
- Gateway redundancy concepts
- HSRP operation and roles
- EtherChannel load balancing

**Outcome:**  
You can build redundant networks and verify high availability behavior.

---

### MODULE 5 — WAN Connectivity & PPP Technologies  
*(PPP, PPPoE)*

**Focus:** WAN links and ISP-style connectivity

Topics include:
- WAN concepts
- PPP vs HDLC
- PAP and CHAP authentication
- PPPoE client/server operation

**Outcome:**  
You can configure authenticated WAN links and understand PPPoE deployment.

---

### MODULE 6 — Mid-Course Revision & Integrated Labs
*(Review VLANs, VTP, STP, and Inter-VLAN Routing)*

**Focus:** Reinforce concepts, verify configurations, and troubleshoot before moving to advanced topics

## Topics Include
- Quick recap of VLAN concepts and benefits
- Access vs trunk ports, 802.1Q encapsulation
- Inter-VLAN routing (Router-on-a-Stick)
- VTP modes, domains, and best practices
- STP operation, root bridge selection, and port states
- Verification commands (`show vlan`, `show vtp status`, `show spanning-tree`, etc.)
- Troubleshooting common Layer 2 issues
- Mini integrated labs combining VLANs, VTP, STP, and routing

## Outcome
You will be able to:
- Recall and explain core Layer 2 concepts
- Verify VLAN, VTP, and STP configurations
- Troubleshoot common Layer 2 and VLAN issues
- Apply learned concepts in integrated lab scenarios

---

### MODULE 7 — Traffic Filtering & Access Control  
*(ACLs)*

**Focus:** Network traffic control and security

Topics include:
- Standard vs extended ACLs
- ACL placement logic
- Traffic filtering verification
- Common ACL mistakes

**Outcome:**  
You can control traffic flow and secure networks using ACLs.

---

### MODULE 8 — Network Services & Address Translation  
*(DHCP, NAT)*

**Focus:** IP addressing and internet connectivity

Topics include:
- DHCP DORA process
- DHCP server and relay
- Static NAT
- Dynamic NAT
- PAT (overload)

**Outcome:**  
You can automate IP addressing, configure NAT, and troubleshoot address translation.

---

### MODULE 9 — Full Revision & Integrated Troubleshooting

**Focus:** End-to-end understanding and exam readiness

This module revises **all Networking 2 topics** through:
- Concept recap
- Command review
- Exam-style scenarios
- Integrated troubleshooting labs

**Outcome:**  
You can connect all Networking 2 concepts together and troubleshoot complex networks systematically.

---

## Packet Tracer Lab Standards

Each Packet Tracer lab includes:
- Topology diagram
- IP addressing table
- Clear objectives
- Required commands
- Verification steps

Labs are designed to teach **why things break**, not just how to configure them.

---

## Tools & Environment
- **Packet Tracer** (primary student labs)
- Verification-driven troubleshooting (`show`, `debug`, `packet flow`)

---

## Disclaimer
This repository contains **my personal teaching material, labs, and revision notes** based on hands-on practice.

It is **not official course material**.  
Always follow your institution’s syllabus and assessment requirements.
